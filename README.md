# Audio-Player
React and p5 audio player and visualizer

This project was an experiment to learn p5 and p5sound.
Using p5 and p5sound, the audio playing is deconstructed into an array of values corresponding to the frequencies playing.
</br>
Thoses values are then mapped to a circle of bars to create a visualizer experience. 
</br>
Project is based on create-react-app to create the whole UI experience with a playlist and to play around with the visualizer values.

Please enjoy :)
